[Blackblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) wanted to provide unlimited storage to their customers for $5/month.

<quoteblock>After looking at several overpriced commercial solutions, we decided to build our own custom Backblaze Storage Pods: 67 terabyte 4U servers for $7,867.</quoteblock>

[Here](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/petabytes-on-a-budget-how-to-build-cheap-cloud-storage/) they detail their process. You can even download a 3D model of their Storage Pod.

<blockquote>A long time ago we stopped measuring storage in our datacenter in gigabytes or terabytes and started measuring in petabytes.</blockquote>


$5/month for unlimited storage is a tall order, but filled by ingenuity.
