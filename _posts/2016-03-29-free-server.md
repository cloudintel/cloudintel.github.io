title: Free Server (kinda)

[InstantCloud](http://instantcloud.io/) is offering a free server...for 20 minutes. To be truthful I kind of mocked this when it come across my feed, but lo and behold, click the button and up pops up a terminal window along with username/password. Log in and wreck some havoc. 20 minutes at a time.

I have to admit I'm impressed with how fast it comes into play. Starter VPS is 2.99 euro's, so about $3.40 in All American Glory.

As of this writing they were still in the invite mode for registration. Hopefully I'll have more to come about this service.
