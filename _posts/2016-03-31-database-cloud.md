[Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) is a fully-managed MySQL database service.

<blockquote>Google Cloud SQL is easy to use. It doesn't require any software installation or maintenance, and scales effortlessly for demanding applications. Cloud SQL automates replication, patch management, and database management.</blockquote>

[Pythian](https://www.pythian.com/blog/benchmarking-google-cloud-sql-instances/) has evaluated the performance of Googleâ€™s Cloud SQL Instances using MySQL Workbench.

They provide a break breakdown of their methodology, but the last line says it all **(Spoiler Alert!)**

<blockquote>Google Cloud SQL High Performance instances performed significantly better than currently being offered Google Cloud SQL Standard Class Instances by a scale of **100-200%**</blockquote>
