[The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/04/monstrous_customer_service_monster_cloud/) recently reported on a Cloud customer wanting a refund. This may sound boring. It's not.

<blockquote>customers who had paid £50 for a year's worth of "unlimited" cloud-based storage were told that they actually had to pay an extra £30 a month for 1TB</blockquote>

As you can image, this triggered some interesting emails, all documented at The Register

<blockquote>As forced by your outragous price increase I have closed the account. I expect a 75%+ refund of the fee I paid you as it was active for less than 3 months. I hope this part of the process is less opaque than your other business dealings.</blockquote>

From this salvo launched by an unhappy customer, the email chain unfolds:

<blockquote>What you may have interpreted as “abuse” is only a statement of fact. At this stage, I am making no comment on the degree of business disruption caused by your self-publicised 8000% mid-contract price increases necessitating additional resources to change provider.</blockquote>

To:

<blockquote>So factually speaking we did not increase our prices 8000%....</blockquote>

And then:

<blockquote>Yes, attitude is definitely there and with justification given the difficulties caused by your imposed price increases.</blockquote>

But enough of this silliness. Go [check it out](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/04/monstrous_customer_service_monster_cloud/) yourself, and think about how you would respond to your customers needs:
