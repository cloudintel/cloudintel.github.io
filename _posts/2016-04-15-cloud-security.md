Do you have files kept in the Cloud that you access via shortened URLs? It's not uncommon. [Cory Doctorow](https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1) details [HERE](https://boingboing.net/2016/04/13/url-shorteners-are-a-short-pat.html) the ill effects of these shortened links.

<blockquote>with only six characters to brute force, it's possible to scan all the URLs associated with a cloud service, locate the open shared folders, and poison them with malware while you plunder them for secrets.</blockquote>

Enforcing that obscurity is NOT an effective measure:

<blockquote>security-through-obscurity method of relying on secret URLs leaves users vulnerable to attacks</blockquote>

And as [Ron Popeil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Popeil) would say "But wait, there's more"

<blockquote>By brute-forcing all Google Maps shorteners, you can discover peoples' private addresses and lots of other sensitive information.</blockquote>

Remember people, the Cloud is just someone else's computer sitting in someone else's closet. Thread lightly.
