[Leonardo Federico](http://www.leonardofed.io/) has a great writeup on setting up a new AWS account detailed [HERE](http://www.leonardofed.io/aws-setup.html). He takes you on a step by step journey, and whether a beginner or seasoned pro, provides a wealth of information.


<blockquote>Getting started with AWS account is something tricky especially when you're moving your first steps in the Cloud and you're so impatient to play (exactly as I did when I put this blog up on AWS) with all kinds of these amazing services. That's why having a solid checklist is something extremely important.</blockquote>

What he details is creating your root account, setting up a password policies and monitoring. If you are already working in AWS and would like to add to his checklist, he has posted to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/4c344w/a_proper_aws_configurations_for_a_new_account/) where others have chimed in as well.
