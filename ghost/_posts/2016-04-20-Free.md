Sometimes you just need a free site to spin up, for a hackathon, demo, or just to try out something new. Well, the fine folks at [POP.co](https://pop.co/) have a detailed, step by step guide on getting you started [HERE](https://pop.co/blog/setup-hosted-wordpress-amazon-aws-free/)

<blockquote>Weâ€™re all about helping people build their awesome ideas here at POP. What better way to kick off a hackathon or build an MVP than setting yourself up with a free Amazon EC2 instance with Elastic Block Storage and Relational Data Service for free.</blockquote>

For the uninitiated this may cover some tech you are not used to, such as SSH, MySQL, private keys and working in the terminal. But this is setting up a server, and not everything has buttons. Sometimes you have to type something in the CLI :)


- Register a Domain with POP
- Create a Free Amazon AWS Account
- Create your EC2 Instance
- Add New DNS Records to POP for your new EC2 Instance
- Setup WordPress on your new EC2 Instance

So there you go folks. Everything you need to get a Wordpress site up on the Cloud. For Free!
